### Project Description:
In today's data-driven world, the healthcare industry is generating vast amounts of data that hold invaluable insights for improving patient care, operational efficiency, and medical research. Leveraging advanced database management systems and analytics techniques, this project aims to stand up a new database utilizing the Health Care Analytics dataset sourced from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abisheksudarshan/health-care-analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abisheksudarshan/health-care-analytics). By employing the powerful combination of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) and Apache Spark, the project seeks to revolutionize the way healthcare data is stored, processed, and utilized.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to set up and explore the functionality of a database utilizing AWS S3 and Apache Spark technology stack, leveraging the MedCamp health care dataset. Specifically, the project aims to:
1. Establish a robust database infrastructure capable of handling large-scale healthcare datasets efficiently.
2. Demonstrate the transformation of raw healthcare data into actionable insights through advanced analytics techniques.
3. Showcase the versatility and scalability of AWS S3 and Apache Spark stack for processing diverse data types.
4. Highlight the advantages of utilizing cloud-based storage and distributed computing for healthcare analytics applications.

### Methodology:
1. Data Acquisition and Preparation: The Health Care Analytics dataset will be sourced from Kaggle, encompassing various aspects of healthcare such as patient demographics, medical procedures, diagnoses, and outcomes.
2. Database Design and Implementation: Utilizing AWS S3 for storage and Apache Spark for data processing and analytics. The database schema will be tailored to accommodate the unique characteristics of healthcare data, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.
3. Data Ingestion and Transformation: The healthcare data will be ingested into the AWS S3 storage, and Apache Spark will be utilized to perform data transformations, aggregations, and analytics tasks.
4. Database Functionality Evaluation: The functionality of the new database will be evaluated in comparison to traditional database management systems. Key metrics such as query performance, scalability, and ease of use will be assessed to demonstrate the advantages of the AWS S3 in combination with Apache Spark architecture for healthcare analytics.
